Practice #1 – “Albion Item Registry”

Build a small CLI exercise to get comfortable with Go’s structs, slices, maps and loops:

Define your domainThink of an “Item” with at least a name (e.g. “T6_Bow”), a category (e.g. “Weapons”) and a price (e.g. 75.3).

Populate a sliceHard-code a handful of items in a []Item so you have data to work with.

Create a lookup mapTurn that slice into a map[string][]Item keyed by category, grouping all bows, swords, armor, etc.

Print your results

Loop through the original slice and display each item.

Then loop through your map and print items by category.

Optional challengeAfter printing, prompt the user to enter a category name (for example “Weapons”) and then only display that group.

CLI (Command Line Interface)

A text-based interface that allows users to interact with software by typing commands into a console or terminal. Commonly used for development tools, scripting, and system administration, a CLI processes user input and displays output directly in the command-line environment.
